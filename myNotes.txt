    React : 
* is library not framework
* Focus on UI not Routing(1) or HTTP Requests
* Has a Rich EcoSystem(2)
* Has a component Based Architecture(3)
* is Declarative(4)
* will handle updating and rendering of the components
* will handle DOM updates


notes:
[1] Routing : is a technology for switching between different UI views,Â based on the changes of the current URL
[2] Rich EcoSystem : the interesting features and libraries that are available to use with React
[3] component Based Architecture : let you to break down the Application into small encapsulated parts then you can compose them and you has the ability also to reuse these components
[4] Declarative : Tell the React what you want and will build the actual UI
    ** Difference between Declarative programming and Imperative programming: 
    Declarative programming is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow.
    Imperative programming is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step.

    **Redux : Redux is a state management library (is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps ) that you can use with any JS library or framework like React, Angular, or Vue.

Components : 
    * Root component (usually called APP) inside it there are 4 components :
        (1) Header component
        (2) Side Nav component
        (3) Main Content Component
        (4) Footer component

Types of Components :
    [A] Functional Component 
        a normal JS function returns HTML
        
        function welcome(props){
            return <h1>hello, {props.name}<h1>
        }
    
    [B] Class Component :
        a class Extending Component Class (from React library) and this class has render Method returns HTML
        
        class welcome extends React.component {
            render(){
                return <h1>hello, {this.props.name}<h1> 
            }
        }

JSX (JavaScript language syntax) : 
    * transiles to pure JS which is understood by Browser
    * Write XML-like code for elements and component
    * have a tag name , attributes and children
    * you can use React without JSX but with JSX code will be simpler
    * class => className -  for => htmlFor - onclick => onClick - tabindex => tabIndex
